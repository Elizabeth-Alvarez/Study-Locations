Another MEAN application to solidify my understanding of CRUD and RESTful applications. This application stores the inputted name so that it can be used within different pages. Because this variable is not stored in the database but as a scope variable, it can be used within web pages as long as the site is not refreshed. Also includes a discussion board where it features post and comment fields. Each location holds its own discussion board where the user can go and create a new post or comment as well as upvoting or downvoting it.
